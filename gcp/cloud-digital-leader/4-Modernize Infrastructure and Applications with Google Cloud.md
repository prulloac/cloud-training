### Key cloud migration concepts

#### Workload

A workload refers to any application or set of applications, along with its associated data, services, and computing resources, that perform a set of tasks. In the context of cloud migration, a workload is what gets moved from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment or from one cloud environment to another.

#### Retire

To retire a workload means to decommission or eliminate it entirely. During a cloud migration assessment, businesses might discover applications or services that are no longer needed or redundant. Retiring these can reduce complexity and costs.

#### Retain

Retaining involves keeping certain workloads in their current environment rather than moving them to the cloud. This decision might be due to regulatory, compliance, or technical reasons, or because the workload is tightly coupled with physical hardware that cannot be easily replicated in a cloud environment.

#### Rehost

Rehosting, often referred to as "lift and shift," involves moving applications and their associated data to a cloud environment without making changes to the applications themselves. This approach is typically the fastest way to migrate to the cloud but doesn't take full advantage of cloud-native features and optimizations.

#### Replatform

Replatforming, or "move and improve," involves making some level of adjustment to the applications to leverage cloud capabilities without a complete overhaul. This might include changes like adopting managed database services or integrating with cloud-based messaging systems to improve scalability and performance.

#### Refactor

Refactoring is a more extensive form of cloud migration, where applications are significantly rearchitected or rewritten to be cloud-native. This approach allows businesses to fully leverage the scalability, performance, and cost benefits of the cloud but requires more time, expertise, and investment.

#### Reimagine

Reimagining involves completely rethinking how a business process or application is designed and implemented, often leading to a radical change that fully exploits cloud technologies and services. This could mean moving from monolithic architectures to microservices or adopting serverless computing models. It's the most transformative approach and can drive significant innovation and efficiency gains but also involves the highest level of risk and investment.

## Computing in the cloud

### Key cloud compute concepts

#### Virtual Machines (VMs)

Virtual Machines (VMs) are software emulations of physical computers. They run an operating system and applications as if they were running on physical hardware. VMs share physical resources from a host machine but are isolated from one another, providing a secure and customizable computing environment. They are a foundational technology for cloud computing, allowing for efficient resource utilization and flexibility in deploying and managing applications.

#### Containerization

Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies (libraries, binaries, and configuration files) into a single container image. This approach ensures that the application runs consistently across different computing environments, from a developer's laptop to a cloud environment, by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure.

#### Containers

Containers are the runtime instances of container images, which include the application and its dependencies. They share the host system's kernel but are isolated from each other and the host system. Containers consume fewer resources than VMs because they don't include operating system images, making them more efficient, portable, and scalable.

#### Microservices

Microservices architecture is a method of developing software applications as a suite of small, independently deployable services, each running its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP-based API. This approach enables organizations to build, deploy, and scale components of an application independently, improving agility and reducing the complexity of updates and maintenance.

#### Serverless Computing

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that abstracts server management and infrastructure decisions away from the developer. Providers dynamically manage the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. It enables developers to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers.

#### Preemptible VMs

Preemptible VMs are temporary, short-lived virtual machine instances offered at a lower price than standard instances. Cloud providers can terminate these instances when they need the capacity for other tasks. Preemptible VMs are suitable for workloads that are tolerant of interruptions, such as batch processing jobs or background tasks that can be easily restarted.

#### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It provides a framework for running distributed systems resiliently, handling scaling and failover for your application, providing deployment patterns, and more. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration.

#### Autoscaling

Autoscaling is a feature of cloud computing that automatically adjusts the number of compute resources assigned to an application based on its current demand, ensuring that the application has the resources it needs when it needs them. This optimizes both performance and cost.

#### Load Balancing

Load balancing is the process of distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, optimizing resource use, maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding overload. Load balancing improves the reliability and availability of applications, websites, and services by spreading the load.

### Benefits of cloud compute workloads

These features are particularly valuable in modern application environments where workloads can be highly dynamic.

### Differences between virtual machines and containers

#### Virtual Machines (VMs)

- **Architecture**: VMs run on a physical server and are managed by a hypervisor, such as VMware's ESXi or Microsoft's Hyper-V. Each VM includes not only the application and its necessary binaries and libraries but also an entire guest operating system (OS). This setup allows VMs to run applications that are completely isolated from each other.

- **Resource Overhead**: Because each VM runs a full copy of an operating system, plus the application and its dependencies, VMs tend to require more system resources (CPU, memory, and storage) than containers.

- **Boot Time**: VMs generally have longer startup times, as booting up a full operating system is more resource-intensive and time-consuming than starting a container.

- **Portability**: While VMs are more portable than physical hardware setups, their larger size (due to the inclusion of the full OS) can make them less convenient to transfer between environments compared to containers.

- **Use Cases**: VMs are well-suited for running applications that require full isolation, extensive security, or are dependent on specific OS configurations. They are also preferable when you need to run multiple applications on different operating systems within the same physical server.

#### Containers

- **Architecture**: Containers virtualize the operating system level, running on top of an OS kernel and sharing it with other containers on the same host system. They package the application and its dependencies (libraries, binaries, etc.) but not the entire OS, making them lightweight and efficient.

- **Resource Overhead**: Containers are more resource-efficient than VMs because they share the host system's kernel and do not need to load a separate OS for each application. This allows for a higher density of applications to run on a single host system.

- **Boot Time**: Containers start almost instantly, as there is no OS to boot. This rapid startup time is advantageous for scaling applications quickly in response to demand.

- **Portability**: Containers are highly portable due to their small size and the fact that they encapsulate all the application's runtime requirements. This makes it easy to move them across different environments (development, testing, production) or cloud platforms.

- **Use Cases**: Containers are ideal for microservices architectures, where applications are broken down into smaller, independent services. They support continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, agile development, and efficient use of resources for high-density deployments.

### Benefits of containers and microservices


#### Enhanced Scalability

- **Fine-Grained Scaling**: Microservices architecture allows individual components or services of an application to be scaled independently, based on demand, without having to scale the entire application. This results in more efficient use of resources.
- **Rapid Elasticity with Containers**: Containers can be quickly started, stopped, or replicated, making it easier to adjust application capacity in real time to meet peak demands. This elasticity is crucial for maintaining performance and user experience.

#### Improved Development and Deployment Speed

- **Faster Iterations**: Microservices enable small, autonomous teams to develop, test, and deploy their services independently, reducing the time-to-market for new features and updates. This autonomy and decoupling reduce dependencies that typically slow down the development process in monolithic architectures.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Containers facilitate consistent environments from development through production, reducing the "it works on my machine" syndrome. This consistency, combined with microservices, supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, enabling frequent and reliable code releases.

#### Better Fault Isolation and System Resilience

- **Isolated Failure Domains**: In a microservices architecture, a failure in one service does not necessarily bring down the entire application, unlike monolithic architectures. This isolation improves system resilience and availability.
- **Rapid Recovery**: Containers can be quickly restarted or replaced in the event of a failure, further enhancing the system's overall resilience. The combination of containers and microservices thus contributes to higher availability and better user experiences.

#### Resource Efficiency

- **Optimized Resource Use**: Containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines, as they share the host system's kernel and require less overhead. This efficiency allows for higher density and more effective utilization of underlying hardware resources.
- **Cost Savings**: Improved resource efficiency and the ability to scale components independently can lead to significant cost savings, especially in cloud environments where you pay for the resources you use.

#### Flexibility and Portability

- **Technology Stack Independence**: Microservices can be developed using the most appropriate technology stack for their specific functionality, rather than being tied to a single stack for the entire application. This flexibility allows teams to adopt new technologies and frameworks more easily.
- **Environment Consistency**: Containers package an application and all its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments and cloud providers. This portability simplifies deployments and migrations, reducing vendor lock-in risks.

#### Simplified Management and Maintenance

- **Decomposition**: Breaking down a monolithic application into microservices simplifies understanding, managing, and maintaining the application. Each microservice can be managed by a dedicated team, aligning with modern DevOps practices.
- **Automated Management**: Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes automate many operational tasks, such as deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, further reducing the operational complexity.

### Business value of Managed Container Products

## The value of APIs

### What is an API

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. It specifies how software components should interact and allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats for requesting and exchanging information between systems, serving as an intermediary layer that enables developers to use certain functionalities of an external application or service without sharing the entire codebase.

APIs can be broadly categorized into several types, including:

1. **Web APIs**: Exposed over the internet, allowing interactions between applications over the web. These often use protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS and are designed to be consumed by external systems.

2. **Operating System APIs**: Define how applications interact with the operating system, including actions like file handling, window management, and process control.

3. **Database APIs**: Allow communication between an application and a database management system. Developers can perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting database entries through these APIs.

4. **Remote APIs**: Facilitate interaction between applications running on different machines, enabling distributed computing. These often rely on communication protocols like RPC (Remote Procedure Call) or SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).

### Business opportunities of APIs

Exposing and monetizing public-facing APIs can open up a wealth of new business opportunities for organizations. By allowing external developers and businesses access to their platforms, data, or services via APIs, companies can extend their market reach, foster innovation, and create new revenue streams.

## Hybrid and multi-cloud

### When to use multi-cloud

Organizations today are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud and multi-cloud strategies to meet their diverse needs, optimize their operations, and drive innovation. These approaches offer distinct advantages, catering to various use cases and strategic objectives. Here's an in-depth look at why organizations choose these strategies and the use cases they support:
