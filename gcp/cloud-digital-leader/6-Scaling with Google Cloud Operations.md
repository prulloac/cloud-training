## Financial governance and managing cloud costs

### Financial governance best practices for predictability and control 

Cloud financial governance refers to the strategies and practices that ensure effective management, monitoring, and optimization of cloud spending. As organizations increasingly adopt cloud services, managing costs becomes a critical challenge. Implementing cloud financial governance best practices can provide predictability and control over cloud resources, helping organizations maximize their cloud investments while avoiding unnecessary expenses. Hereâ€™s how these best practices contribute to financial governance in the cloud:

#### Establishing Clear Policies and Budgets

**Predictability**: Setting clear policies for cloud usage and budgets at the outset provides a framework for predictability. It ensures that all teams are aware of spending limits and the need for cost optimization, reducing the likelihood of budget overruns.

**Control**: By defining who can provision what services and setting approval workflows for exceeding budget thresholds, organizations can maintain tighter control over cloud resources, ensuring that spending aligns with business objectives.

#### Implementing Tagging and Resource Management

**Predictability**: Tagging resources with metadata, such as cost centers, projects, or environments, enables detailed tracking of cloud spending. This granularity allows organizations to forecast future spending more accurately based on historical data.

**Control**: Effective resource management, aided by tagging, enables organizations to identify underutilized or orphaned resources that can be decommissioned or downsized, directly controlling costs without impacting performance.

#### Utilizing Cloud Cost Management Tools

**Predictability**: Cloud cost management and optimization tools provide insights into spending patterns, identify trends, and forecast future costs. These tools often include budgeting features that alert teams when spending approaches or exceeds predefined thresholds.

**Control**: These tools also offer recommendations for cost-saving opportunities, such as identifying cheaper resource alternatives or suggesting changes to reservation plans. Acting on these recommendations allows organizations to optimize their cloud spending actively.

#### Encouraging a Culture of Cost Awareness

**Predictability**: Fostering a culture where all stakeholders are aware of and responsible for managing cloud costs leads to more predictable cloud spending. When teams understand the financial impact of their cloud usage, they are more likely to make cost-effective decisions.

**Control**: A cost-aware culture empowers teams to continuously seek optimization opportunities, contributing to a more controlled and intentional use of cloud resources. Regular reviews of cloud spending against budgets and objectives reinforce this control.

#### Adopting FinOps Principles

**Predictability**: FinOps, or Cloud Financial Management, is a practice that brings financial accountability to the variable spend model of the cloud. It involves cross-functional teams working together to balance speed, cost, and quality. Adopting FinOps principles improves predictability by aligning cloud spending with business value.

**Control**: FinOps practices provide mechanisms for real-time decision-making regarding cloud use, ensuring that organizations can quickly adjust to changes in demand or priorities. This agility allows for better control over cloud costs in response to business needs.

#### Leveraging Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

**Predictability**: Committing to reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads can significantly reduce costs compared to on-demand pricing. These commitments allow organizations to forecast their cloud expenses more accurately over the contract term.

**Control**: By carefully selecting and managing reserved instances and savings plans based on usage patterns, organizations can optimize their cloud spending, ensuring they are not paying for more capacity than needed.

### Key concepts

#### Cost-Related Terms

- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** Upfront costs associated with purchasing physical assets like servers or data centers.
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx):**  Ongoing costs of running and maintaining resources, such as compute, storage, networking, and licensing fees. Cloud spending typically falls under OpEx.
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** The complete cost of owning an asset over its lifetime.  Includes CapEx, OpEx, maintenance, and any potential disposal costs.  
- **Unit Costs:** The price of individual resources, e.g., cost per virtual machine per hour, or the cost per GB of storage.
- **Chargeback:** Attributing cloud costs to specific business units, projects, or teams within an organization. This is crucial for aligning cloud expenses with budgets.
- **Showback:** Reporting cloud costs for visibility and awareness, but not directly associating them with specific units for billing purposes.  Can help in budget forecasting.

#### Cost Optimization Concepts

- **Right-sizing:** Matching your cloud resources (e.g., virtual machine size, storage type) to your actual workload requirements. This prevents overprovisioning and ensures you stay within budget.
- **Reserved Instances (RIs) & Committed Use Discounts (CUDs):**  Pre-purchasing cloud resources for 1-3 years at a significant discount compared to on-demand pricing.  These strategies require careful budget planning.
- **Spot/Preemptible Instances:** Utilizing deeply discounted instances that can be revoked with short notice, ideal for non-critical, fault-tolerant workloads. Useful for opportunistically expanding capacity within budget constraints.
- **Autoscaling:**  Automatically adding or removing compute resources based on demand, helping match capacity to workload needs while optimizing budget utilization.
- **Workload Scheduling:** Running certain workloads during off-peak hours when costs may be lower. Helps maximize budget efficiency.
- **Cloud-Native Architectures:**  Designing applications to leverage serverless technologies and auto-scaling features, reducing the need to manage infrastructure. Can lead to more cost-predictable architectures, which aids in budget planning.

#### Cost Analysis, Visibility, and Budgeting

- **Cost Allocation Tags:** Labeling cloud resources with metadata (teams, projects, cost centers) allowing precise cost tracking, reporting, and budget alignment.
- **Cost Anomaly Detection:**  Using tools or setting up alerts to identify unusual or unexpected spikes in spending, indicating potential waste or departures from budget projections.
- **FinOps:** A collaborative practice bringing together finance, technology, and business teams to drive cloud financial accountability, optimization, and strong budget adherence.
- **Budget Alerts:** Setting up proactive notifications when cloud spending approaches or exceeds pre-defined budget thresholds.

#### Additional Considerations

- **Vendor Lock-In:** The difficulty and cost associated with switching cloud providers due to dependence on proprietary technologies.  Can impact your ability to optimize costs or shift budgets as needed.
- **Shadow IT:**  Cloud resources provisioned outside of centralized IT control, making it difficult to track spending, enforce governance, and stay within budget.
- **Hidden Costs:** Be aware of potential costs for data egress (moving data out of the cloud), support contracts, and overheads of managing cloud environments.  Factor these into your budget planning.

### Benefits of using resource hierarchy

- **Simplified Management at Scale:** GCP's structure (Organization > Folders > Projects > Resources) mirrors how most companies are organized. This allows you to grant permissions at higher levels and have them inherited downwards, vastly simplifying access management for large numbers of resources and users.
- **Policy Inheritance:**  IAM permissions set on a parent resource propagate downwards. For example, granting "Editor" role at the Organization level gives that user edit rights across all projects within it (unless overridden by more specific policies)
- **Centralized Control with Granular Overrides:** You can set broad baseline policies at the Organization or Folder level, then fine-tune access controls for specific projects or resources as needed. This balances security with flexibility.
- **Delegation of Administration:** Folder-level permissions allow you to give teams autonomy to manage their own projects' resources, without granting them access to the entire organization.
- **Logical Structure for Cost Allocation:** Using projects and folders to group resources aligns with logical business units. This helps accurately track cloud costs and apply chargebacks or showbacks.

#### IAM Implementation Notes

- **Least Privilege Principle:** Always assign the minimum necessary permissions. 
- **Predefined Roles:** Google provides granular predefined roles (e.g. 'roles/storage.objectViewer') for common actions.  Use these over custom roles when possible.
- **Avoid Assigning Permissions Directly to Users:**  Favor granting permissions to groups, making management easier when team membership changes. 

### Benefit of controlling cloud consumption

#### Resource Quota Policies

- **Enforcing Hard Limits on Resource Usage:** Quotas set strict limitations on the number of resources that can be provisioned within a project or region. Examples include:
  - Limits on the number of virtual machines per region.
  - Maximum storage volume in use.
  - Caps on the number of specific API requests.
- **Preventing Uncontrolled Sprawl:** Quotas safeguard against unintentional overuse due to development errors, unexpected load spikes, or even malicious actions that could cause runaway resource provisioning.
- **Operational Stability:** By setting sensible quotas, you can help ensure resources are available for critical workloads and prevent competition for resources within your cloud environment.

#### Budget Threshold Rules

- **Financial Safeguards:** Budget rules focus on the cost aspect of cloud consumption. You set spending thresholds on a project or across the whole organization.
- **Proactive Alerts:** Rules trigger notifications when spending reaches specific percentages of your defined budget (e.g., 50%, 90%). This provides early warnings and allows time to take corrective action.
- **Automated Actions (Optional):**  More advanced budget rules can trigger actions like disabling billing for a project (a drastic measure to prevent runaway bills). This depends on your risk tolerance.
- **Cost Forecasting and Accountability:** Budgets encourage proactive cost tracking and planning, helping teams stay financially responsible for their cloud usage.

#### How They Work Together

- **Preventive vs. Reactive:**  Quotas act as preventative measures, stopping resource creation when limits are reached.  Budgets are primarily reactive tools that notify when spending is approaching thresholds.
- **Technical vs. Financial Control:** Quotas deal with raw resource counts, while budgets center on expenditure. Both are crucial for a comprehensive control strategy.
- **Unexpected Outages vs. Overspending:**  Quotas can help prevent unexpected downtime if a rogue process suddenly consumes all resources. Budgets help catch overspending, allowing for course correction or budget adjustments.

### Cost visualization with Cloud Billing Reports

#### Key Benefits

- **Granular Analysis:** Go beyond high-level dashboards and dissect your costs by project, product, SKU (individual cloud services), resource labels, and more.  This allows you to pinpoint areas of unexpected spend.
- **Customizable Views:**  Create reports that align with your specific interests or analysis needs. You can filter, group, and chart data as needed.
- **Trend Spotting:**  Visualizations of cost data over time help identify patterns, seasonality, and potential areas for optimization. This can assist in forecasting and budget planning.
- **Easy Sharing:**  Cloud Billing Reports can be stored, scheduled for delivery, or exported as CSV or JSON files for distribution to stakeholders and use in external analysis tools.

#### How to Visualize Data in Cloud Billing Reports

- **Access Reports:** Go to the Cloud Billing Reports page in the Google Cloud Console. ([invalid URL removed]).
- **Set up a New View:**
  - **Filtering:**  Focus your report by selecting relevant projects, specific time ranges, services used, or labels applied to resources.
  - **Grouping:** Structure the data by project, resource type, location, or other categories. 
  - **Chart Types:** Choose from line charts, bar charts, stacked area charts, and more to best represent the desired view.
- **Save Your View:** Give your report a descriptive name and save it for later access. You can set up scheduled reports to be delivered regularly.
- **Refine and Analyze** Create multiple views to explore different angles of your cost data.  Over time, you'll develop tailored visualizations to quickly identify cost drivers and inform optimization decisions.

#### Examples of Useful Visualizations

### Importance of designing for cloud

Here's a breakdown of why designing for resilience, fault tolerance, and scalability is crucial for high availability and disaster recovery:

#### High Availability (HA)

- **Minimizing Downtime:**  HA focuses on maximizing uptime. When systems are resilient and fault-tolerant, outages due to hardware failures, software bugs, or unexpected load spikes are less frequent and their impact is minimized.
- **User Experience:**  Customers and users expect services to be always on. Lengthy outages damage brand reputation and can lead to customer churn. HA is key to delivering a seamless user experience.
- **Revenue Protection:**  Downtime translates into lost revenue for many businesses. This can be catastrophic for e-commerce, SaaS, and other online services. HA strategies protect your business's bottom line.

#### Disaster Recovery (DR)

- **Business Continuity:**  Disasters (natural, human-caused, or technical) can completely disrupt operations. DR plans enable rapid restoration of critical systems in other locations, minimizing the duration and cost of the disruption.
- **Data Preservation:**  Data is the lifeblood of modern businesses. DR strategies include replicating and backing up data in a secure way, preventing data loss during catastrophic events.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Many industries have regulations for data retention and recovery time objectives (RTOs), which DR planning directly addresses.

#### How Resilience, Fault Tolerance, and Scalability Achieve This

- **Resilience:**

  - **Self-healing Systems:**  Systems that automatically detect and recover from failures, perhaps by restarting components or shifting traffic to healthy systems.
  - **Redundancy:**  Deploying multiple instances of critical components or services so if one fails, others take over.

- **Fault Tolerance:**

  - **Graceful Degradation:** When failures are unavoidable, the system degrades partially or switches into a limited-functionality mode, rather than failing completely.
  - **Failovers:**  The ability to seamlessly switch traffic or operations to standby systems when primary ones fail.

- **Scalability:**

  - **Elasticity:**  The ability to add or remove resources rapidly as demand changes. This combats downtime during both sudden demand spikes and unexpected component failures when loads need to be redistributed.
  - **Distributed Architectures:**  Spreading services across multiple data centers or regions ensures localized failures don't take down the entire service.

#### The Interconnectedness

These aren't isolated concepts, they work best hand-in-hand:

- A scalable infrastructure gives you the flexibility to add redundancy for fault tolerance.
- Fault tolerance mechanisms often rely on quick deployment of resources, which scalability enables.
- Highly available solutions must be designed to tolerate individual component failures and recover seamlessly.

#### Key Points

- **Cost vs. Risk:** Achieving perfect HA/DR is impossible and costly.  You need to balance investment vs. the acceptable level of risk for your business.
- **It's not just about Technology:** People and processes matter.  DR plans, regular testing, and a culture of reliability are just as important as the technology itself.

### Cloud reliability, DevOps, and SRE
